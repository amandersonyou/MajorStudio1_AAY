# Met API Fetching

For this project, we are working with the Met's API to make a quantitative 
analysis. We are pulling data on a topic of our choice, and making a visualization.

I am exploring the average lifespan of an artist and when in their life they
created their art. I'm containing this data set to the Modern Art department, 
and specifically looking at works of art/artists that the Met considers "notable".

To do this, I'm looking at departmentID 21 (Modern Art), and using object parameters:
artistBeginDate, artistEndDate, objectDate, and isHighlight (notable). 

I played around with the app Postman to help in my query, however I'm currently
having difficulty seeing the data set change with the addition of the parameters.
