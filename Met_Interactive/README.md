# Met Interactive Project

For the third project of Major Studio 1, I am again working with the the landscape 
data from the Met API. I have evolved an earlier concept from the qualitative project 
and made a visualization that creates new landscapes out of slices of landscape paintings 
from the Met's collection. The slices are randomly ordered, and aligned at their horizon 
lines for a unique, collaged curation.

The goal of this visualization is to allow for artistic exploration and to encourage the 
viewer to see the landscape paintings in a new way. The slices bring your attention to 
small details that get lost in the full artwork, but stand out when juxtaposed next to 
other related, but different artworks. 

My process begins with determining my dataset. I pulled images from the Met API that 
had the medium of painting, and the keyword of landscape. Of the hundreds of results, only 
thirty paintings had open access downloadable art.
