This visualization was created using JavaScript to divide 30 open access landscape paintings from the Met into 441 individual equal height and width slivers. 
Each sliver was assigned a horizon line level based on where the image’s horizon line fell. I created a guide to consistently hand-measure the slivers and 
provided each new image a value between 0 and 1. When between values, I rounded up or down to whichever level was closest.

Next, using P5.js code and an extensive .json object file, I created new landscapes out of the sliver elements. The collages are grouped: ordered randomly 
and aligned by horizon line, by artist’s culture, and by horizon level to create a new exploration of the Met’s landscapes.
